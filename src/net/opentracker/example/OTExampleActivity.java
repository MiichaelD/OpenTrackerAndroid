/**
 * 
 * This class is an example of how to extend an activity that will use
 * Opentracker's logging/ analytics engines.
 * 
 * Android's activity class is focused on things that the user can do. Almost
 * all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
 * creating a window for you in which you can place your UI.
 * 
 * You can use Opentracker's logging services to log the users/ or systems
 * activity.
 * 
 * Declare Internet permissions in your apps manifest by adding the following
 * line to AndroidManifest.xml. This allows your application to use any Internet
 * connections and for the application to know what network type is being used
 * (Wireless/ mobile)
 * 
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
 * 
 * Note if you see: DEBUG/SntpClient(69): request time failed:
 * java.net.SocketException: Address family not supported by protocol, then this
 * is android that failed to contact the internet time server, and is normal.
 * 
 * Note we implement SeekBar.OnSeekBarChangeListener to work with seek bar
 * events.
